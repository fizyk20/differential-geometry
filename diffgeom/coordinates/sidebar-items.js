The information about the coordinate system is saved in the type parameter, so that only operations on objects belonging to the same coordinate system will be allowed."]],"trait":[["ConversionTo","Trait used for conversions between different coordinate systems. Implementing `ConversionTo<T>` for a `CoordinateSystem` will allow objects in that system to be converted to the system `T` (note that `T` also has to be a `CoordinateSystem`)."],["CoordinateSystem","`CoordinateSystem` marks a struct (usually a unit struct) as representing a coordinate system."]]});
